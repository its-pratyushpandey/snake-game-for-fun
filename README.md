# Snake Game in React

A classic Snake game implemented using React. This project demonstrates modern React best practices and provides an engaging browser-based gameplay experience. Players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall.

## Features

- **Responsive Gameplay**: Playable on desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Smooth Controls**: Use keyboard arrows (or swipe gestures on mobile) for intuitive control.
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score updates based on food consumed.
- **Game Over Logic**: Automatic detection of collisions and game reset functionality.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily adjust grid size, speed, and colors.
